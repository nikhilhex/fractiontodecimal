# fractiontodecimal
Creating a fraction to decimal converter in as many programming languages as possible...


# Introduction


If you are seeing this, you might be confused. This a small project of mine where I'm using a small formula: `decimal = numeratorOfFraction divided by denominatorOfFraction` and creating a program of it in as many programming languages as possible.

I will include a guide for as many languages as possible!
